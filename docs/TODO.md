# Databases

I have a database with the astrophotography data.  It's sqlite.  this database is managed by me and completely under my control.  a snapshot of this database is found at reference/astrophotography.sqlite

I use a scheduling plugin in NINA for planning imaging sessions.  I don't know if we need that database, but a snapshot is located at reference/schedulerdb.sqlite

I will need to explain what happens as items transition from one stage to tne next.
I do not use a spreadsheet anymore, any reference to that should be instead to the astrophotography.sqlite database but it should be general at this time as this program we are going to write will change that workflow implementation.
